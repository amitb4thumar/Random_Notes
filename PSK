Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming proficient in living according to these five values:

Commitment

Courage

Focus

Openness

Respect

These values build a foundation of trust, which is required to bring the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation to life.

----------------------

The Kanban Core Practices
Visualize (the work, workflow, and risks to flow/value delivery)

Limit WIP (Work in Process)

Manage Flow

Make Process Explicit

Implement Feedback Loops

Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally (using models and the scientific method)

----------------------------

 -> Limiting the Work in Process, which in a Scrum context means you limit the amount of PBIs in progress at any time.
 
 -> The Sprint itself is a WIP Limit.  A Sprint limits the number of PBIs that a Development Team forecasts it can complete during a fixed period. 
 
 -> The team will look at the cycle times of PBIs for information on where there is room for improvement. Cycle time is a measure of the amount of time that has passed as an item on the Kanban board moves between two stages in a value stream.
 
 -> By using reports such as cycle time control charts and cumulative flow diagrams, Scrum Teams can gain deeper insights into the flow of work, thus driving improvement experiments that donâ€™t surface as a result of a classic Sprint Retrospective.
